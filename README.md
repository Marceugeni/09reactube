# React Tube 
## A Youtube clone for selected or themed content
##### In this example we will create a Youtube clone with selected Jazz videos. This videos will be curated by the author and are not 'hardcoded'. Instead we're going to use the Youtube API for passing the information to our App.

This project is ITacademy's (Barcelona Activa, Cibern√†rium) final project for the bootcamp.
